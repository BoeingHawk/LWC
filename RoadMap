📌 LWC Learning Roadmap
Here’s a step-by-step guide to learning Lightning Web Components (LWC) from scratch:

1️⃣ Prerequisites (Before You Start LWC)
Before diving into LWC, you should be comfortable with:

📌 Web Development Basics
✔️ HTML (Tags, Forms, Tables, Attributes)
✔️ CSS (Selectors, Flexbox, Grid, Styling)
✔️ JavaScript (Variables, Functions, Loops, Events, Objects, ES6 Features)

🎯 Recommended Learning:

HTML & CSS → w3schools.com
JavaScript Basics → MDN JavaScript Guide
📌 Salesforce Basics
✔️ Salesforce Data Model (Objects, Fields, Relationships)
✔️ Understanding Lightning Experience & Lightning App Builder
✔️ SOQL Basics (Salesforce Object Query Language)
✔️ Apex Basics (Methods, DML, Triggers)

🎯 Recommended Learning:

Salesforce Platform Basics → Trailhead Module
✅ If you’re comfortable with these, you’re ready for LWC!

2️⃣ Beginner Level: Core LWC Concepts
Goal: Build simple Lightning Web Components and understand the basics.

📌 1. Setting Up the Development Environment
✔️ Install Salesforce CLI
✔️ Install VS Code & Salesforce Extensions
✔️ Set up a Salesforce Developer Org
✔️ Authenticate with Salesforce using:

sh
Copy
Edit
sf org login web --set-default-dev-hub
🎯 Recommended Learning:

Salesforce DX Setup → Trailhead
📌 2. Creating Your First LWC Component
✔️ Understand the LWC Folder Structure
✔️ Learn about HTML, JavaScript, and Meta XML files
✔️ Deploy LWC to Salesforce
✔️ Add LWC to a Lightning Page

🎯 Hands-On Exercise:
✅ Build a "Hello, World!" LWC Component
✅ Use button click events to change text dynamically

📌 3. Data Binding & Event Handling
✔️ @track vs Reactive Properties (this.property)
✔️ @api (Public Properties & Parent-Child Communication)
✔️ Handling Events (onchange, onclick, input)

🎯 Hands-On Exercise:
✅ Create an input field where the user types their name and updates a greeting dynamically.

📌 4. Conditional Rendering & Iteration
✔️ if:true / if:false for conditional display
✔️ for:each loop for lists
✔️ iterator for advanced loops

🎯 Hands-On Exercise:
✅ Display a list of items dynamically (e.g., a to-do list).

3️⃣ Intermediate Level: Working with Salesforce Data
Goal: Fetch & display Salesforce records in LWC.

📌 5. Calling Apex in LWC
✔️ Use @wire to call Apex methods
✔️ Use Imperative Apex Calls
✔️ Handle loading states & errors

🎯 Hands-On Exercise:
✅ Fetch Account records from Apex and display them in LWC.

📌 6. Using Lightning Data Service (LDS)
✔️ Fetch records using getRecord
✔️ Use getFieldValue() to extract field data
✔️ Create, Update, Delete Records with LDS

🎯 Hands-On Exercise:
✅ Create an editable Account Detail component using LDS.

📌 7. Working with Lightning Data Table
✔️ Use lightning-datatable to display records
✔️ Implement Sorting, Filtering, and Inline Editing

🎯 Hands-On Exercise:
✅ Build a table to display Contact records with an Edit & Delete button.

4️⃣ Advanced Level: LWC Performance & Best Practices
Goal: Improve performance & make your components reusable.

📌 8. Parent-Child Communication
✔️ Pass data from Parent to Child using @api
✔️ Call Child Methods from the Parent Component

🎯 Hands-On Exercise:
✅ Build a Parent-Child communication example with dynamic updates.

📌 9. Navigation & Messaging in Salesforce
✔️ NavigationMixin (Redirect to Record Pages, List Views)
✔️ Lightning Message Service (LMS) (Cross-component communication)

🎯 Hands-On Exercise:
✅ Create a button to navigate to a Contact record.

📌 10. Working with External APIs
✔️ Fetch data from REST APIs inside LWC
✔️ Handle CORS Issues & Security

🎯 Hands-On Exercise:
✅ Fetch weather data from an external API and display it in LWC.

5️⃣ Expert Level: Advanced Topics & Deployment
Goal: Deploy LWC in production & work with enterprise-level apps.

📌 11. LWC Testing & Debugging
✔️ Use Lightning Debug Mode
✔️ Write Jest Tests for LWC

🎯 Hands-On Exercise:
✅ Write unit tests for a simple LWC component.

📌 12. Packaging & Deploying LWC
✔️ Create a Second-Generation Package (2GP)
✔️ Deploy LWC to Production or Sandbox

🎯 Hands-On Exercise:
✅ Package your LWC and install it in another Salesforce Org.

📌 Final Capstone Project
🎯 Build a "Task Manager" App in LWC
✔️ Create Task records with a form
✔️ Display tasks in a data table
✔️ Mark tasks as Complete
✔️ Store data in Salesforce using Apex

🚀 Summary: Your LWC Learning Path
✅ Beginner
✔️ HTML, JavaScript, Salesforce Basics
✔️ Creating & Deploying LWC
✔️ Data Binding, Event Handling, Loops

✅ Intermediate
✔️ Fetching Data with Apex & LDS
✔️ Displaying Salesforce records in Lightning Data Tables
✔️ Parent-Child Communication

✅ Advanced
✔️ Navigation & Message Service
✔️ Calling External APIs
✔️ Testing & Debugging

🎯 Final Step: Build a real-world LWC project to master your skills!
