  <p id="demo"> Hi this is a HTML page and I am using JS to practise.</p>

<script>

const person = {
    name: "Pulkit",
    age: 26,
    city: "BLR"
};

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.name + " " +person.age + " " + person.city;

//console.log(person);


</script>

</body>

</html>


//output: 

[object Object] 
Pulkit 26 BLR

//because only object is getting printed, but in console output will be different, it will show the entire object along with the properties.
